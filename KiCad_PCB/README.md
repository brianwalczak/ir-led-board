Welcome! This folder includes a custom-designed printed circuit board for the `ir-led-board`, allowing you to control 16 IR LEDs in groups of four. This PCB was designed as an easy way to connect the components and use them via GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

This PCB was designed in KiCad (you can import it with `File > Open Project` and exported as a ready-to-print Gerber file. This PCB can be printed for about **~$2.00** (quantity of 5) on [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (not sponsored).

**All routing has been automatically done by [Freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting): an open-source auto-router for KiCad, built with Java.**
