# `ir-led-board` - 3D Print

Welcome! This folder includes a custom-designed 3D printable case for the `ir-led-board`. The model was designed to securely hold the board and its components, as well as providing protection to prevent damage to the board.

This PCB was designed in Fusion 360 and features a secure, compact design to attach the PCB with 4x M3 screws. These screws can be threaded straight through the pre-designated mounting holes.

The M3 screws should be round head and 8mm in length. An example set of screws can be found on AliExpress [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806672911442.html).
