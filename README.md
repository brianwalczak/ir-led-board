#### PCB Design
A custom-designed printed circuit board, designed in KiCad 9.0, allowing you to control 16 IR LEDs in groups of four. This PCB was designed as an easy way to connect the components and use them via GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

#### 3D Model (case)
A 3D printable case, designed in Fusion 360, made to securely hold the board and its components, as well as providing protection to prevent damage to the board.
